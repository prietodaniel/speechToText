# speechToText
Software created with python and qt, to transcribe audios to text.

At the moment, it only works for one language (spanish default but you can set language manually by changing "es-ES" to "en-US", for example.). It supports WAV/AIFF/FLAC, you need FFMPEG Installed on your computer to support MP3.
